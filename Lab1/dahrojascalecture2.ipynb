Its purpose is to clarify the source code and make it easier for people to follow along with what is happening. Anything in a comment is generally ignored when the code is actually run, making comments useful for including explanations and reasoning as well as removing specific lines of code that you may be unsure about. Comments in Python are created by using the pound symbol (`# Insert Text Here`).

Functions in Python have an enclosed scope, making it so that variables defined within them can only be accessed directly within them. If we pass those values to a return statement we can get them out of the function. This makes it so that the function call returns values so that you can store them in variables that have a greater scope.\n"," \n","In this case specifically, including a return statement allows us to keep the string value that we define in the function."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"s-t5JZSf8_ki"},"source":["def free_the_scope():\n","    in_function_string = \"Anything you can do I can do better!\"\n","    return in_function_string\n","my_string = free_the_scope()\n","print (my_string)"],"execution_count":94,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Anything you can do I can do better!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WhSVvfq18_ki"},"source":["Just as we can get values out of a function, we can also put values into a function.
